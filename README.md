# odin-recipes

This is my first webpage project that I did in order to showcase the basics of HTML and CSS.

In this project, I will make a recipes webpage with links to several different recipes. Each recipe will be displayed on a different tab that you can access using a link from the main webpage.

The three recipes are lasagna, chicken katsu, and sirloin steak.
