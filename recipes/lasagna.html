    <h2 class="title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all your ingredients. </li>
        <li> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. </li>
        <li> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
             Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 &frac12 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and &frac12 teaspoon salt. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li> To assemble, spread 1 &frac12 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. 
             Spread with &frac12 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 &frac12 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with &frac14 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. </li>
        <li> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
