    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. 
        If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories. </p>
   <p> You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below </p> 

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> &frac12 cup butter </li>
        <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons garlic powder </li>
        <li> 4 pounds top sirloin steaks </li>
        <li> Salt and pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li> Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside. </li>
        <li> Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness. </li>
        <li> Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving. </li>
